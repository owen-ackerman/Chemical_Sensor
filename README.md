# Chemical_Sensor
This project is to create a VOC sensor for 3D printer environments.

Draft 1 will use an Arduino nano + Wifi mod with an RGB LED to indicate Low Medium and High chemical levels.

Draft 2 will send this data to a mobile app (or octoprint) to notify the user on the status of air quality

During this process, a statistical analysis comparing 3 sensors data, logging with a CSV file, 
will determine the effective accuracy and margin of error that can be reliably accepted from the sensors.
